# The results obtained are as follows: 

1. Uni1: p-value obtained from dip test = 0.9828 and predicted Modality = 1

2. Bi1: p-value obtained from dip test = 0.0 and predicted Modality = 2

3. Bi2: p-value obtained from dip test = 0.3480 and predicted Modality = 2

4. Tri1: p-value obtained from dip test = 0.00032 and predicted Modality = 3 (showing multimodal dataset and not actual modality)
